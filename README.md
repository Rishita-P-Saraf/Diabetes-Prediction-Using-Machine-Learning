# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building classification models to predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on health-related attributes. Three supervised learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated: **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
